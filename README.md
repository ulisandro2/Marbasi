Welcome to Marba, a company with over 14 years of expertise in electrical and thermomechanical infrastructure. We take pride in our highly skilled workforce and specialize in critical installations where a disruption in supply is not an option.
This is my second freelance project where I create a landing page for an SME (small/medium-sized company) where they can show their services, see their work, see clients and contact forms.

## About Us

Marba is committed to continuous improvement and recognizes the importance of ongoing training. In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, we invest in our team's knowledge to meet the evolving needs of our clients. Our track record includes successfully addressing diverse challenges and fulfilling the requirements of our clients, regardless of the complexity or scale of the project.

Marba operates as a cooperative, decentralized SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise) with a formal authority system. Our cooperative structure aligns with neoclassical principles, emphasizing division of labor, specialization, hierarchy, and clear distribution of authority and responsibility. Each role within Marba involves specific and specialized functions, reflecting the efficiency gained through the division of labor.

## Organizational Philosophy

In addition to formal proposals aligned with neoclassical principles, Marba embraces informal approaches inspired by the Human Relations school. We value social relationships within the company, encourage interdepartmental cooperation, and promote camaraderie. Our goal is to facilitate the flow of information within the organization, fostering open communication between executives and employees. Marba recognizes and rewards exceptional performance with incentives and rest breaks.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structural foundation of the landing page.
- **CSS3:** Styling and design elements.
